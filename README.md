A short metroidvania platformer where you play as a cube. Collect powerups and optional medals as a challenge.

This archipelago implementation shuffles the powerups and medals. Defeat the boss to reach victory.

The version of MetroCUBEvania is shipped with AP integration and has been modified to use the GPIO layer to communicate with archipelago.js, and additional functionality has been added to display some messages from the archipelago server.

To launch the game run metrocubevania.html in the client folder and it will open in your default browser. The .p8 file is for development purposes, you do not need to run it or own the PICO-8 standalone console to play.
